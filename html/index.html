            <p class="para">I am an American soldier....<br>
                But when I'm not, I am a problem solver, a go-getter, a peace maker and a knowledge seeker. Since I can remember I have always tried to figure out how things work. My mother stopped buying me toys when I was young because I would take them apart to see what's inside. Now, I take apart ( and put back together ) big toys that belong to the military. If it moves, I fix it! I have been apart of a team that helps our warfighters stay in the fight by providing them with world class equipment maintenance and repair for well over a decade. I'm proud of what I do for my fellow soldiers and airmen of this great nation and will always find a way to continue to serve them in any capacity I can.
                <br><br>

                But I'm not just a gear head I'm a tech enthusiast as well. I started studying programming in the early 90's with BASIC. Then moved on to C/C++. I remember when Java came out and all the hype around it! Write once, run anywhere they said! I have and will always have a deep interest in programing but only until recently could I devote more attention to it.
                <br><br>
                When I'm not working on Humvees or cargo loaders I'm spending my time to study the art and science of programing.
                My current languages are: C++, C#, JavaScript(HTML/CSS), Python,
                My current frameworks I've used include: ASP.Net, Bootstrap, Django, DotNet, Node.js

                And just for fun I also dabble in Unity and Unreal Engines.
